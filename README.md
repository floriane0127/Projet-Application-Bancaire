# Projet-Application-Bancaire

The Projet-Application-Bancaire is based on the value of **Sharing** in the companies specialized in IT. 

The application offers a platform where the employees can share the anomalies and hurdles they meet, and they can not find a solution, or they have already found the solution, and they want to share it with their colleagues. 

The difference between StackOverFlow (Or any others platform) and this application is that Projet-Application-Bancaire is dedicated to the internal framework of companies and different internal products that use APIs and Libraries developed in the internal scale. 

In that way you can give and get a hand in a more **efficient** and secured way (You don't have to put your source code on the internet) ;)

The application's features are:

- Share a Knowledge (Can be a hurdle that you are meeting or something that you resolved) related to a certain project and customer.
- Users can interact about a Knowledge with comments
- Manage Users
- Manage Projects
- Manage Customers

This repository contain the Backend part of the application and offer a restful API.
